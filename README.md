## Background ðŸ”Ž
---
A small surgical hospital that specializes in orthopedic procedures currently does not have an inventory management system for their supply ordering. The inventory for their procedures is
maintained by a visual inspection of the staff. Knowing how much of each supply to order is also an estimation on the behalf of the staff. The issue with this is the staff frequently overestimate the number of needed supplies for the center resulting in an excess of supply boxes blocking the staff hallway and wasted money. Occasionally, a needed supply will also be missed resulting in either rush shipping costs or an item no being available for a procedure resulting in decreased surgeon satisfaction. 

To aid the hospital staff with their inventory management, a dashboard capable of displaying ordering data over time as well as an estimation page based on surgeon preference that can display a more accurate estimate of the number of needed supplies is being created.

âœ¨ This project is currently being completed for a class assignment. The rubric of the assignemnt requires that a tool/product be created to aid in solving a business problem. Real data from a real hospital is being used for this project, as such names of suppliers, the hospital, and other data such as PO has been altered. Raw data will not be provided. Thank you for understanding! âœ¨
